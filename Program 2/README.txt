Distance Vector Routing

Group Members: Joseph Craft, Matt Rovine, Mikayla Hously
Professor: Dr. Lu

*Program code reference from textbook as well as lecture and discussion.

to compile the program:

	cc prog3.c node0.c node1.c node2.c node3.c
	./a.out

Personal Contributions:
	Joseph Craft:
		- Did the main testing and codeing for the program as well as 
		  research into the functions needed to perform the tracroute
		  for each node. The only issue I had was sometimes the code
		  would return a warning for transmitting to non connected nodes.
		  Assisted in writing the main paper for the program

	Matt Rovine
		- Assisted in the coding as well as debugging of the 
		  code. Wrote the main paper for the program. Came across 
		  and solved some of the challanges faced in using the
		  cc compiler.

	Mikayla Hously
		- Assisted in the writing of the paper as well as
		  debugging of the code.
